My name is *Matthias*; Iâ€™m trained in electrical engineering, entrepreneurship, and corporate finance; I worked in senior executive positions in Europe (where I had built and restructured telecommunication companies) and as a serial founder.
I take courses in Technical Physics (with an emphasis on non-linear dynamics, optimal control, complexity theory) and some in astrophysics and cosmology. As an alumnus of the International Space University (ISU) I was one of the organizers of the 48h non-stop marathon Alumni Space Conference 2021. My research interests are in [von Neumann Self-replication](https://iafastro.directory/iac/paper/id/73256/summary/), Prediction Models, and Complex Economics (at present: thermodynamics applied to economics). Lately, with some ISU fellows, we are running a [space podcast show](https://www.spaceforward.space), deconstructing how humankind can become multi-planetary from first principles.

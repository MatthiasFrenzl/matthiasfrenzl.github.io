I"ê<p>The <em>Tufte-Jekyll</em> theme is a natural extension of the work done by <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">Edward Tufte</a> and his collaborators on Github who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials.</p>

<p>To incorporate these styles into a Jekyll theme, I have made some very slight modifications that attempt to maintain the feel of the CSS styles in his Github repo.</p>

<p>Note that this is a full-width layout. This was accomplished by including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layout: full-width</code> in the YAML front matter for this page. Keep in mind that all the Tufte-Jekyll sidenote and marginnote goodness will not work on full-width layouts!</p>

<p>You can find the source code for Jekyll at <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">github.com/jekyll/jekyll</a>.</p>

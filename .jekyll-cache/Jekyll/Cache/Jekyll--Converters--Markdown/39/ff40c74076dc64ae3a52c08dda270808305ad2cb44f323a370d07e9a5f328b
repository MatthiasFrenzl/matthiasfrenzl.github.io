I"H<p><span class="newthought">In this first iteration</span>  of the <em>Tufte-Jekyll</em> theme, a post and a page have exactly the same layout. That means that all the typographic and structural details are identical between the two.</p>

<h2 id="pages-and-posts">Pages and Posts</h2>

<p>Jekyll provides for both pages and posts in its default configuration. I have left this as-is.</p>

<h3 id="posts">Posts</h3>

<p>Conceptually, posts are for recurring pieces of similar content such as might be found in a typical blog entry. Post content all sits in a folder named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> and files are created in this folder<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Yes, a page has essentially the same old shit as a post </span> that are names with a date pre-pended to the title of the post. For instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2105-02-20-this-is-a-post.md</code> is a perfectly valid post filename.</p>

<p>Posts will always have a section above the content itself consisting of YAML front matter, which is meta-data information about the post. Minimally, a post title must always be present for it to be processed properly.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
Title: Some Title
---
## Content

Markdown formatted content *here*.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="pages">Pages</h3>

<p>Pages are any HTML documents <em>or</em> Markdown documents with YAML front matter that are then converted to content. Page material is more suited to static, non-recurring types of content. Like this</p>

<p>I am not going to re-write the Jekyll documentation. Read it and you will figure out how the site is structured.</p>
